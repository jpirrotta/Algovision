## Algovision

Hey! I'm Jesse, and this project which I am calling Algovision is intended to be a high quality algorithm visualizer. I intend to make it as user-friendly as possible with a high fidelity front end design that allows potential users to easily learn all about the complicated world of algorithms.


## Roadmap 
- [ ] Create a basic front end design
- [ ] Implement a basic and reusable algorithm visualizer that follows the Strategy design pattern
- [ ] Implement sorting algorithms
- [ ] Implement pathfinding algorithms
- [ ] Implement graph algorithms
- [ ] Implement tree algorithms
- [ ] Add educational resources for each algorithm
- [ ] Final deployment of website!

## Technologies
- Next.js 15
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Branches
- `master` - The deployed version of website
- `dev` - The development branch where all new features that are **presentable** but not yet ready for deployment are merged
- `feature/feature-name` - The branch where a new feature is being developed that is not presentable or working yet
